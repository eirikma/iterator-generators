 * Lambda type to use for generators: loops outputting (possibly infinite sequences of) values that should be iterated over.
 *
 * A Generator is called whenever someone wants to consume objects they produce. If the Generator
 * doesn't yield any values, the stream is considered ended. An Iterator delivering the values
 * yielded by the Generator will then reply with 'false' on the next call to 'hasNext()'.

         * and all the previously yielded values have been consumed.
         * If no values are yielded, the Iterators hasNext()-method will return false and the
         * generator is finished. More than one value may be yielded. These will be kept in memory
         * until they are consumed by the iterator.
